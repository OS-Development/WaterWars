README - WaterWars 0.9

Welcome to Water Wars.  Water Wars is a serious game that allows many players to
take part in water resource decisions in a part of the San Luis Valley, where the Rio
Grande flows.

The game takes place in a 3D virtual environment which is hosted on a server.
Each player takes part in the game via a graphical client.

Water Wars is implemented on the OpenSimulator platform.  As such, the Water
Wars package consists of the following components

1.  WaterWars.dll   - An OpenSimulator region module that contains the game logic
and code to interface with OpenSimulator and the web interface.

2.  oars/rg*.oar    - OpenSim ARchives which model a portion of the Rio Grande and
contain the game objects.

3.  web/waterwars/* - Web UI code which displays the game information panel in-world
and links this back with the WaterWars game code.

Please see the files in the doc directory for building, installation, gameplay
and hacking instructions.
