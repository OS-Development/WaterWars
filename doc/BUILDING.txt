BUILDING

Water Wars is built as part of the OpenSimulator build.  To do this

1) Move the entire waterwars directory into the addon-modules/ directory of your OpenSim installation.

2) Re-run prebuild.sh (or prebuild.bat) in your OpenSim root directory.

3) Re-build the OpenSim distribution as normal using the command "xbuild".  You should see the
WaterWars.dll built as the last component.  The DLL ends up in addon-modules/waterwars/bin/WaterWars.dll

Now follow the INSTALL.txt instructions.
