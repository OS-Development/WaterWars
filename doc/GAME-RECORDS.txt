GAME RECORDS

During the game, the Water Wars region module records all the events that take
  place to an XML file.  This is in OpenSimulator's bin/recorder directory.
Each file has a timestamp embedded in the name, so subsequent game records will
not overwrite earlier ones.

The game records can be validated using the ww-game-record.xsd XML Schema in
this directory.  Due to a current game bug, before validation will succeed you
may have need to add the "http://waterwars.com/game-record" namespace to the root 
Game element of the record, like so

<Game xmlns="http://waterwars.com/game-record">

A large number of events are recorded, both those pertaining to game actions
(e.g. buying a parcel, building a factory) and the actions that players take
while navigating the game world and communicating with other players.

The XML Schema gives some idea of how this file is structured, but for a full
understanding one will have to be familiar with how the game works.
