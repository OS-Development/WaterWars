PLAYING

Starting, stopping and resetting the game is controlled via the 'capitol
building', a roundhouse situated in RioGrande 23.  You can get further
instructions for playing itself by clicking the building and then clicking the
"Help" button in the menu.

Game parameters are configured in-world via the "Game Configuration" notecard in
the roundhouse.  This directory also contains a spreadsheet
(game-parameters.xls) to do some very simple outcome modelling when different
game parameters are selected.
